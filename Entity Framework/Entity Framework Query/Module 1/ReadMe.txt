Sample solution for "Querying Entity Framework Overview" 

This project contains the model and the tests used to explore querying with the Entity Framework.

There is also a sql script for creating the database, AdventureWorksLT which is used for this solution.

The connection string in the app.config files points to a SQL Server instance of the database. Modify the connection string as necessary based on where you create this sample database.
